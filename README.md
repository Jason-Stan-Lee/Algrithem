Solutions to some algrithem questions


1. Number if tasks running:

    Given n tasks that start and end at (unix) time:(n < 1000)

          [start 1, end 1), [start 2, end 2), ... , [start n, end n)
          of which all starting times are inclusive and all ending times are exclusive

    Write code to efficiently return the number of tasks that are running at m given times:(m > 100000)
          query 1, query 2, ... , query m

    Function Definition

    void number_of_tasks_running(
                               OUT int number_of_tasks_running[],
                               IN     int start[],
                               IN     int end[],
                               IN     int n,
                               IN     int query[],
                               IN     int m) 
    {

    }

    Example

    input: 

         n = 3;
         m = 4;
         start = [0, 5, 2];
         end = [4, 7, 8];
         query = [1, 9, 4, 3];

    output:

         [1, 0, 1, 2]


2. Find missed number:
  
    Given an array which have n-1 items,

    the range of this items is [1, n],

    the array missed one of them,

    Write code to find the missed number.

    Function Definition

    int find_missed_number(
                         int array[],
                         int n)

    {

    }

    input:

        int array[] = {1, 2, 4};
        n = 4;

    output:

        3;


3. Number of digit one:

    From Leet Code 233:

    Given an integer n, count the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

    For example:

    Given n = 13,

    Return 6, because digit 1 occurred in the following numbers: 1, 10, 11, 12, 13.
